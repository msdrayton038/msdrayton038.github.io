As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <span id="sec1">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span id="sec2">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span id="sec3">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
    <span id="sec4">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,is his loyalty to a flower --
the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp,even when he is asleep..."</span>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him to be more
fragile still.<span id="sec5"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by
    little puff of wind...</span>
